# Python-Tutorials-Projects
In my quest of switching from MATLAB to Python, I have gone through a number of practice problems and examples provided in the textbook "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". 
Below are the scripts that I have printed for record purposes.

Please note that the scripts in this repository were not plagiarized from the said textbook or other learners/developers. 
I went through the problem statements provided and formulated my own solutions to each without referring to other codes.
